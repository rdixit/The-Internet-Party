# The Internet Party

A new political party where you decide how your representatives vote.

# Why?
American democracy is in dire straights.

71% of Americans say they don’t trust the government.
Only 1 in 10 Americans approve of Congress.
The two-party system is broken.

What if we could upgrade the “operating system” of the government without a constitutional amendment?

Well, we found a way.


# How it works

1
Sign in to vote on legislation important to you
Our secure online portal allows you to view, discuss and vote on all upcoming legislation, as well as propose new legislation.


2
Choose someone to vote on everything else
Our proxy system allows you to defer your vote to someone more informed on issues you don’t care or know enough about. That person can also pass along all of their votes to someone else. You can take back your vote at any time. Learn more


3
Our representatives mirror the popular vote
Elected party members are bound to vote on legislation in accordance with the online majority vote, thereby creating a true direct democracy.


# Timeline
We imagine a new America revolutionized by technology.

There are three months until the next U.S. election, with historically unpopular candidates fronting an out-of-touch gerontocracy.

What are you waiting for? Join us.
